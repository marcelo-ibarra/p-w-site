## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job with milestone 1. Your purpose, audience, goal, and persona are all clear and descriptive, and your HTML is clean and formatted well. Your use case not quite where it should be, explained below.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- Your use case needs to explain the **Who/What/Where/When/Why** of your persona. You should structure it as an explanation for why/how the persona you created found your site, and what they want to accomplish while they are visiting it.
