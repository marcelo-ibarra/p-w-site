## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job with milestone 1. Your purpose, audience, goal, and persona are all clear and descriptive, and your HTML is clean and formatted well. Your use case not quite where it should be, explained below.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

- Your use case needs to explain the **Who/What/Where/When/Why** of your persona. You should structure it as an explanation for why/how the persona you created found your site, and what they want to accomplish while they are visiting it.

## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Nice work on the wireframes. These will provide you with a nice guide as you commence development on the site. In your Site Map you list both a Portfolio page and a Gallery page. Unless there is a specific reason to feature both pages, I would strongly suggest rolling these together into one. Also, you can optionally place your Contact Form on your About page as well if your content is on the lighter side. 

Intricate UI elements like gallery images and contact forms can be more complex to code up - so think carefully about how you would like these elements to appear and function. Take a look at the [Bootstrap Thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails) and [Bootstrap Forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms) here, and the corresponding HTML structure. I highly recommend giving the [Bootstrap Challenge Activity](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~rlewis37/bootstrap-practice/) a try, as it's great practice before you begin on PWP. 

There are also quite a few 3rd-party plugin options open to you regarding your gallery. [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) provides a nice jQuery plugin for a galley "lightbox" that is responsive and mobile-friendly. It is also relatively easy to implement as well. 


Overall, nice work here. Your site map and content strategy are well done. Additional refinement on your UI in the wireframes may help you as you begin development. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric) You are clear to begin development on your PWP.

- [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) provides free icons that you can use for your social media links.
- When it comes to large background images, my advice is to keep the file size less than 500kb, but be sure that the pixel dimensions are large enough to display well on large screens.
